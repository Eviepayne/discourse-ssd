This plugin revises how discourse works by default allowing users to delete their own posts and accounts.

# Why isn't this the default?
Technically it is the default
But only in the very specific circumstance that there are no replies, and the topic was made less than 24 hours ago.

The opinion of a small group of people is that giving users the ability to delete others posts is bad (note that posts are the replies to a topic)

You see this opinion in so many places

It is strange that the developers enforce their opinions on how data ownership works.
It is also strange that they refuse to give admins the option to allow this of their users.

# But they do allow account deletion
In order to delete your account you are at the whim of the discourse admins.
If you have more posts than the site setting: delete user self max post count
which is by default 1
if this is -1 then you are not allowed to delete your account.
You also can't delete your account id you have a post older than: delete user max post age
which is by default 60 days

So by default, as long as you have 1 post with a reply, or a post older than 24 hours, deleting your account without admin intervention is impossible.
This is unacceptable.
